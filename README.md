> Projects

<b>1st Project: The aim of the project is to apply algorithms for searching and finding the best path in a maze of dimensions NÃ—N </b>

<b>2nd Project: The aim of the project is to build a Recommendation System for movies. These suggestions will be derived both from the characteristics of the film and from certain evaluations of each user. </b>

<b>3rd Project: In this project, various (relatively simple) machine learning algorithms will be implemented for the automatic recognition between 3 music genres from the data provided by the Spotify service.</b>
